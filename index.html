           <p>My name defines a lot of who I am. I like to behave like a star in the solar system: with intensity, brightness and authenticity. I learned to be a Scientist when I graduated in Biology, discovering my critical, researching and questioning side. I learned to be a Data Scientist in my postgraduate studies, where I realized that I could use my scientist side to look at analyses with different eyes, and obtain important information through data. </p>

                            <p> I did my research at Laboratory of Theoretical Ecology in UFSCar Sorocaba wich started in 2019 and finished in 2020. 
                                In this process, I learned how to perform Exploratory Analysis and Statistical Data Manipulation.
                                The research entitled: "Temporal resource partitioning and stochastic colonization explain the co-occurrence of gall-inducing insects in the super-host plant Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Fabaceae)"", was published in the journal Austral Ecology.
                                After publication in the journal, I presented my paper at the international symposium: 2nd Symposium on the Biology of Galls 2020.</p>
